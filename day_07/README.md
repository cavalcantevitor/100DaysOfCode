# Hangman

Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase, or sentence and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers within a certain number of guesses. In this case, the computer will choose the word and you have to guess it. You have 6 lives, good luck!
