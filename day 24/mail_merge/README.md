# Mail Merge

This Python script generates personalized letters by replacing a placeholder ([name]) in a starting letter template with names from a list. It reads a starting letter template and a list of names, creating individualized letters for each name. The generated letters are saved in the "Output/ReadyToSend" directory with file names based on the original names.
