# Day 24

This folder has 2 projects: improved_snake_game and mail_merge

## Improved Snake Game

It is the same game that was done back in day 21, but now it saves your high score in a `.txt` file, so that you will never lose it

## Mail Merge

This Python script generates personalized letters by replacing a placeholder ([name]) in a starting letter template with names from a list. It reads a starting letter template and a list of names, creating individualized letters for each name. The generated letters are saved in the "Output/ReadyToSend" directory with file names based on the original names.
