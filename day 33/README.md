# ISS Tracker and Email Notifier

This Python script tracks the International Space Station (ISS) using its real-time coordinates obtained from the Open Notify API. It then determines if the ISS is near the user's current position and if it's currently dark at the user's location. If both conditions are met, it sends an email notification to the user to inform them that the ISS will be visible in the sky.
