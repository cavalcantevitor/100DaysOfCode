# Basic Calculator

This Python script implements a basic calculator with support for basic math operations:

- Addition (+): Adds two numbers.
- Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second number from the first.
- Multiplication (\*): Multiplies two numbers.
- Division (/): Divides the first number by the second.

## How to Use

1. Run the script.
2. Enter the first number.
3. Choose an operation from the available options (+, -, \*, /).
4. Enter the second number.
5. View the result and decide whether to continue with the result or start a new calculation.

## Considerations

The user can perform multiple calculations in sequence. To start a new calculation, the user can choose to exit the current calculation and input a new set of numbers and operations.

Feel free to customize or enhance the code based on your preferences or specific use case!
