# Blackjack Game

Welcome to the Blackjack Game! This Python console-based game allows users to play the classic Blackjack card game against a computerized opponent. The project follows standard Blackjack rules with a few modifications:

- The deck is unlimited.
- Jacks, Queens, and Kings all count as 10.
- Aces can be counted as either 11 or 1.

The game features functions for dealing cards, calculating scores, and comparing the results between the player and the computer. The user interface is text-based, and the game prompts the player to decide whether to draw additional cards or pass.

## How to Play

1. Run the program.
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to decide whether to draw a card or pass.
3. The game will automatically calculate scores and determine the winner.
4. After each game, you can choose to play again or exit.
